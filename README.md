# RockPaperScissorsApp

This programme runs with one command line argument, which should either be 'human' or 'computer' This determines whether the game will run with two players, or with one player against the computer, which makes random moves. The default is human.

When playing with two players, the programme will prompt the first player to enter either R, P or S (not case sensitive), and then the second player to do the same. Invalid inputs will trigger a re-prompt. If one player wins, the programme will say this, display statistics about the game, and exit. If nobody wins (both players make the same move), the game will go to the next round.

When using the 'computer' option, the game works the same way except the second player's moves will be automatically chosen, at random.
